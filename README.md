# Lightning payments using OpenNode

In this workshop we will be creating a public message board where every message is paid for using Lightning.

Check out what we will end up with: [Demo Message Board](https://opennode-workshop-final--ruigomes.repl.co/)

## Working on Bitcoin's Testnet

This workshop runs on the Lightning Network Testnet.
To easily pay for testnet Lightning invoices, check out the [HTLC.me wallet](https://htlc.me).

Please be warned that API keys generated on a regular OpenNode account will *not* work on testnet.

You have to create a specific account on OpenNode Dev - https://dev.opennode.co.
If you can see the "Dev Environment" tag next to the OpenNode logo you're in the right place!

> Hint: If you'd like to run this app on mainnet instead, create a regular OpenNode account at https://opennode.co/signup and change the API base URL from https://**dev-api**.opennode.co to https://**api**.opennode.co
